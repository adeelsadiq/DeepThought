##Useful git commands

- `git checkout <branch>`  >>> checks out a branch.
- `git pull <branch>`  >>> pull code from the specified branch into your current branch.
- `git add <file>` >>> add file to tell git to use it in the next commit 
- `git commit -m "<comment>"` >>> commits all added files to local repository
- `git push` >>> pushes all commits to remote repository (to bitbucket)
- `git status` >>> tells you the current state of your code changes
- `git stash` >>> removes all changes made (does not include anything commited) kind of like ctrl -x does to text
- `git stash apply` >>> restores all the changes removed by the last git stash. kind of like ctrl -v does to text

## Project Brief

Object-Oriented Programming
Pair Project
Get together in pairs.

**Develop a Java SE application that includes the following functional elements:**
1. Perform streamed input/output from/to the Console
2. Employ Strings, Arrays and ArrayLists as appropriate
3. Handle exceptions
4. Process file input/output streams
5. Include Graphical User Interface components

**The application must make use of the following Object-Oriented programming principles:**
1. Modularity (discrete re-usable units, such as Classes)
2. Class Inheritance (with Abstraction where appropriate)
3. Data Encapsulation (visibility of Classes, variables and methods)
4. Instantiation (static or instance variables and methods, as appropriate)
5. Polymorphism (method overloading and overriding)

**And employ code quality mechanisms, such as:**
1. Naming conventions
2. Explanatory comments
3. Code file layout
4. Don’t Repeat Yourself / Single Responsibility Principles
5. Documenting the project with UML Class Diagrams

**You are free to decide what exact application you will be developing, as long as you meet the
requirements.**

**This project is worth 40% of module marks:**
- Each item in the functional list is worth 3 marks.
- Each item in the principles list is worth 3 marks.
- Each item in the code quality list is worth 2 marks.

**Each item will be assessed as:** not done / poor / sufficient / good.

- Details of each category will be discussed in the lectures. 
- Use the labs to seek feedback from the lecturer on the progress of your project.
- Email your group members’ names and project idea to diana.ferreira@tudublin.ie by
23/10/19.
- Any external code snippets must be properly acknowledged (for example with comments in
the code).
- Remember the policy on plagiarism – outside of your own group, facilitators and
perpetrators, both get zero.
- Submit your project in a compressed ZIP folder via Brightspace by 23:59 on 02/12/19.
- Include the code, deployment folder, and a readme.txt with configuration and deployment
information.
- One submission per group is enough, but make sure there is one.
- Late submissions are not accepted, unless justified and certified with a PC Form.
- Mandatory demos in class on 04/12/19 and 11/12/19, schedule TBC.
- Each group, regardless of the demo date, will receive their submitted code from the lecturer
to perform the Demo, so groups demonstrating later do not get extra time to work.
- Absent students will not receive marks.

**Individual assessment based on contributions to group work:**
- Each group member inherits the overall group project mark. 
- This mark is then adjusted by their individual contribution.

The individual contribution will be assessed via individual presentation and discussion at the demo.

Both team members should be adequately familiar with the entire project.

For example:
- Final group result: 76%
- Student with perfect demonstration of contribution receives: 100% * 76% = 76%
- Student with just sufficient demonstration of contribution receives: 50% * 76% =
38%

Please contact the lecturer in case any aspect of this assignment is not clear to you. Have fun!
